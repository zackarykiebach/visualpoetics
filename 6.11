<h1>Visual Poetics: From Concrete to Digital</h1>
<h4>Zackary Kiebach</h4>
<p>The phrase “visual poetry,” at first glance, might be considered a term rooted in redundancy. 
    What poetry is, to at least some extent, not visual? 
    Even the most obedient poem is immediately distinguishable as a visual object. 
    Opening any literary anthology, we can readily categorize a work into either “prose” or “poem” before we encounter its narrative content simply by the way it looks on the page. 
    A poem will give us immediate visual cues in the form of enjambment or the breaking of text into discrete stanzas, whereas prose generally will follow the horizontal logic of the paragraph block. 
    Poems are also often visual in terms of the content they evoke, as W.J.T. Mitchell points out that the view of poetry in the 17th and 18th centuries was it must facilitate “pictorial production and reproduction,” rendering discrete images in the mind of the reader through the mechanism of text. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
    A similar focus might be attributed to Imagism, with Ezra Pound’s “Direct treatment of the ‘thing’” as one of three dictums defining the movement, published in the March 1913 issue of Poetry. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>Willard Bohn, one of the leading scholars in visual poetry, has categorized the genre as one that simply heightens the visual elements of the work: visual poetry is, as he suggests throughout his career, simply “poetry that is meant to be seen.” <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  
    In Bohn’s determination, the visual poem is not simply one that evokes a strong visual image in the mind of the reader (as we encounter with the 17th century, as well as Imagist work), nor is it a simple characterization of the non-linguistic similarities that “poems” share transhistorically. 
    All three of Bohn’s major critical publications on the topic—The Aesthetics of Visual Poetry (1986), Modern Visual Poetry (2001), and Reading Visual Poetry (2011)—each begin with the exact same deceptively simple provocation. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>  
    So, what does it mean when a poem is “meant to be seen,” rather than heard or simply read in one’s head? 
    We also might question Bohn’s specific choice of language here in the definition he provides: why must the poem be “seen” rather than, for instance, “looked” at or upon?</p>
<p>Regarding this latter point, I would suggest that “looking” connotes the physical act of directing our eyes toward the page, which is precisely the mode of reading we perform when reading a sonnet by Shakespeare or an ode by Keats. 
    We look upon the words simply to facilitate their translation into the images conjured by their content, rather than “seeing” the visual dimensions of the form it takes on the page. 
    The primary point of comparison for how we are meant to encounter visual poetry as a “seen” object is painting.  
    With the visual poem, we can no longer relegate the audience to the role of “reader” but must acknowledge her simultaneous role as a “viewer” as well. 
    Willard Bohn suggests the cohabiting of two separate art practices to be “neither a compromise or evasion but a synthesis of the principles underlying each medium,” which he clarifies in his following book by suggesting that “[w]ords no longer serve as simple notational devices but as building blocks in a visual edifice.” <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>    
    Words become analogous to oil or acrylic paints, a substance that is both sculptural and possess a stalwart materiality. 
    Willard Bohn similarly locates certain formal similarities in work that constitute “visual poetry,” as that materiality is achieved by a rejection of linear modes of writing and an emphasis on the compressed logic of the icon. <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    “Visual poems are immediately recognizable by their refusal to adhere to a rectilinear grid and by their tendency to flout their plasticity,” Bohn suggests. “. . . Whether the visual elements form a rudimentary pattern or whether they constitute a highly sophisticated design, they transform the poem into a picture.” <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> </p>
<p>Visual poetry is often erroneously used interchangeably with concrete poetry, despite the specificity of the latter as a historically distinct movement founded by the “two separate, if convergent traditions” of Eugen Gomringer (Germany) and the Noigandres group (Brazil). <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>  
    Both mutually agreed on the unified term “concrete” during a meeting in Ulm in 1955, and each contributed to mapping out the aesthetic and ideological stakes in their specific formulation of visual poetry. 
    An early example occurs in 1951, when Eugen Gomringer began writing what he would call “constellations” (a term gleaned from Mallarme), rejecting the logic of the line we have grown to expect from most verse in favor of poetry that “encloses a group of words as if it were drawing stars together to form a cluster.” <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>  
    In a series of manifestos laying defining a “concrete” poetics more specifically, Gomringer establishes it as an international movement with an aesthetic agenda far more distinct than that we encounter in Willard Bohn’s definition of visual poetry. 
    In his manifesto “Concrete Poetry,” Gomringer suggests that the form of concrete work inevitably has language structures that differ from that of traditional verse, and the content is concerned less with “emotions and ideas” and is itself only interesting to the extent they can be handled as language. <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>  
    In a later manifesto, Gomringer argues that the poem must become “a functional object,” as “easily understood as signs in airports and traffic signs.” <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>  
    Gomringer’s provocative claim characterizes the staunch minimalism of his own work, as meaning is reduced and compressed to achieve freedom of communication across linguistic borders.</p>
<p>	The Noigandres group sets out a similar set of dictums for the “concrete” image-text, while remaining distinct from its European cousins. 
    In their 1958 manifesto “Pilot Plan for Concrete Poetry,” the Noigandres poets, made up of the de Campos brothers and Decio Pignatari, trace their forerunners to Mallarme, Pound, Joyce, Cummings, and Apollinaire, while also acknowledging the influence of both concrete visual art and the music of Webern, Boulez, and Stockhausen. <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>  
    The primary tenet they ascribe to the concrete poem is that it always “begins by becoming aware of graphical space as a structural agent,” as the poem’s emphasis on nonverbal communication facilitates its ontological status as a structure in itself. <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>  
    Similar to the position set forth by Gomringer, the Noigandres rejects the poem-object as a receptacle for the communication of subjective feelings, labeling themselves as “against a poetry of expression, subjective and hedonistic.” <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Stephen Bann, in his formative Concrete Poetry: An International Anthology, notes a tension here in his reading of Haraldo de Campos’s “cristal,” which collapses the phrases “forma de fome” (form from hunger) and “fome de forma” (hunger for form). 
    “The poet recognizes the problematic status of art in a world where the majority of human beings go hungry,” Bann writes. “yet he must also acknowledge his own need, or ‘hunger,’ for form.” <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>  
    The poetry of the Noigandres group predicts a similar debate that would come to dominate the literary avant-garde over the following decades: can form have a social politic? 
    We might connect the push for a politicized mobilization of form embodied by the Noigandres group to Charles Bernstein’s later provocation that it is, in fact, impossible to criticize a dominant culture through the same formal structures through which it reproduces itself. <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>  
    Formal experimentation is not only an avenue through which a social politic might be expressed, but a necessity. </p>
<p>	The defiance of linearity and lyric subjectivity that many theorists have ascribed to concrete poetry further deepened with the various technological affordances granted by the advent of the personal computer, as visual poetry more generally took a distinct turn toward the digital. 
    The earliest monograph on the subject is Loss Pequeño Glazier’s Digital Poetics: The Making of E-Poetries, which divides electronic poetry into three principle forms of electronic textuality: “hypertext, visual/kinetic text, and works in programmable media.” <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>  
    Glazier specifically cites Eugen Gomringer, the de Campos brothers, Emmett Williams, Dick Higgins, and Ian Hamilton Finlay direct precursors to the non-linear visual economy we have come to expect of digital poetry, whose similar debt to the French Symbolist movement is readily apparent in electronic work as well: Apollinaire’s “Coeur Couronne et Miroir” is described as “ASCII art at its finest.”<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>  </p>
<p>C.T. Funkhouser, in Prehistoric Digital Poetry: An Archaeology of Forms, 1959-1995, similarly tracks the development of digital poetry before the advent of the internet, beginning his study historiographic project with Theo Lutz’s “Stochastische Texte” text-generator from 1959 (which he cites as the earliest digital poem).<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>  
    Similar to Glazier, Funkhouser directly names concrete poetry as the most immediate precursor to the aesthetic practices that characterize digital poetry, in particular the “sculptural interplay of letters and words through bold typography, coloration, and repetition.” <sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>  
    The “bridge period” between page and pixel was one that Funkhouser locates in the 1970s and early 1980s, as poets move from the material practice of Letraset fonts to the increasingly plastic, mutable capacities offered by the personal computer. 
    Funkhouser is clear to note that the slow adoption of digital media is not a result of resistance but a simple lack of access: poetry in the 1960s was run on corporate mainframes, which often cost upward of $10,000 and lacked the ease of a graphical user interface or computer mouse.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>  </p>
<p>	To map out a genealogy connecting digital poetry with its concrete predecessors, I have scanned and assembled poems from four major anthologies defining visual poetics in the 20th century: Concrete Poetry: A World View, edited by Mary Ellen Solt; Concrete Poetry: An International Anthology, edited by Stephen Bann; Concrete Poetry, edited by Nancy Perloff; and Imagining Language, edited by Jed Rasula and Steve McCaffery. 
    I have decided to break these into four discrete sections, exploring the various affordances granted by the shift from typewriter to computer. 
    The first two lists map out perhaps the most immediately striking elements of the digital poem, as it is liberated from the page into a multimedia object of motion and sound. 
    The next two elements are more indebted to the interactive affordances made by computer code, primarily examining how authorship is complicated with the emergence of combinatoric and permutation poems as well as the evolution of the hyperlink.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that these four categories are by no means exhaustive, and merely a beginning at mapping a few areas in which a genealogy between concrete and digital poetics might be established. 
    Other fertile areas of inquiry might include the evolving notion of a haptic poetics that digital poetry (as we exchange the brittle texture of the page for the smooth and responsive interface of the touchscreen), or even the digitization of physical texts into electronic libraries (as explored in Manuel Portela’s Scripting Reading Motions).
     In an effort to focus on the predecessors to digital poetic practice, I have also chosen to limit my examples to the concrete work from which these categories have emerged. </p>
<h2>Kinetics & Motility</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most commented upon affordances that the personal computer made to poetry is the ability for words to be set in motion, a visual form that Funkhouser traces back to the mid-1960s with poems both on screen and in printouts.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>   
    An often-cited example of the affordance of mobile text is Brian Kim Stefans’ The Dreamlife of Letters (2001), a flash animation based on a text by Rachel Blau DuPlessis in which appropriated words cascade and bounce across a burnt orange background. 
    Christopher Funkhouser goes as far as to argue that all digital poems that do not utilize hypertext can be divided into the categories of either “static” or “kinetic,” defining kinetic writing as that in which “optical mutation of words and letters is the operative principle; poems, by design, move and change before the viewer’s eyes.”<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>   
    Funkhouser then divides “kinetic” work into two further subcategories of “projected” and “interactive,” the former referring to work in which words are plotted into motion and the latter describing those in which the viewer sets the poem’s parameters or interacts with the words themselves.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>   </p>
<p>While it is tempting to describe the “kinetic” dimension of poetry as one which blossoms solely with the advent of digital technology, the role of motion in a text has proven integral to pre-digital writing as well. “Motion is as fundamental to poetry as it is to cinema, and both mediums are put together in similar ways . . . and out so similar materials,” Lyn Hejinian writes. “. . . Just as there are no frozen moments, there are no motionless meanings. Meaning and motility are inextricable.”<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>   
    Concrete poets such as Emmett Williams and Ian Thomas Finlay have attempted to render dynamic pieces that “capture” a sense of motion, an extension of Futurism’s own goal of lifting the word from the static plane of the page.</p>
